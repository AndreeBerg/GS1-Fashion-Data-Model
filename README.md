# GS1-Fashion-Data-Model
Further development of the fashion data model.
This repository contains all necessary information for the fashion industry to implement data exchange in the GS1 Fashion data model.
# Motivation
The GS1 aims to facilitate data exchange for participants in the fashion industry. Faster production cycles, a larger number of data exchange partners and the increasing importance of product data in times of e-commerce require a smooth data exchange. The agreement of a standard ensures that a uniform "language" is spoken within the fashion industry. The focus has been placed on simple use and implementation, as well as on the needs of internationalization and the associated multilingualism of data.
